    Fix rechaining of pseudo-resurrected string keys.
    
    This is a serious bug. But extremely hard to reproduce, so it went
    undetected for 8 years. One needs two resurrections with different
    main nodes, which are both in a hash chain which gets relinked on
: 
    key insertion where the colliding node is in a non-main position. Phew.
    
    Thanks to lbeiming.
